Q1: Why prefer VARCHAR(n) vs TEXT? When does it matter?
- VARCHAR(n) lets you enforce a max length. Use when you know or want to limit user input (e.g. usernames). May have slight performance benefits, helps with data integrity.
- TEXT is for variable/unknown-sized data (comments, posts).

Q2: What does SERIAL actually do in Postgres?
- SERIAL auto-generates a sequence and sets the default for the column to the next value of that sequenceâ€”it's used for creating auto-incrementing IDs.
